    "\n",
    "    * Syntax error: It means a Python interpreter in the process of analyzing or more precisely parsing the code, fails to be able to generate executable program. \n",
    "    * Runtime error: It occurs when Python detects some illegal operations when the code is already running. Python will stop running when runtime error occurs unless explicitly be instructed what to do by the code.\n",
    "    * Logic error: It refers to the situation when a program can successful finish but its outcome is not expected. This often indicates some design problems of the code logic itself.\n",

In this lecture, we will also not able to cover every type of syntax and runtime errors. Instead, we will focus on the most commonly encountered errors, especially for those who are at the beginner and intermediate levels of Python programming."
